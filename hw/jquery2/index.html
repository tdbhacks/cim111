          <h2>About the city</h2>
          <p>
            Tumbling down to the Adriatic from a wild plateau and almost
            entirely surrounded by Slovenia, Trieste is physically isolated from
            the rest of the Italian peninsula. The city blossomed under the 18th-
            and 19th-century Habsburgs; Vienna's seaside salon was also a
            fluid borderland where Italian, Slavic, Jewish, Germanic and even
            Greek culture intermingled.
            <br>

          <h2>Castello di Miramare (Miramare Castle)</h2>
          <p>
            The Miramare Castle is a 19th-century castle on the Gulf of Trieste,
            located in northeastern Italy. It was built from 1856 to 1860 for
            Austrian Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian and his wife, Charlotte of
            Belgium, later Emperor Maximilian I and Empress Carlota of Mexico,
            based on a design by Carl Junker.
            <br>
            The castle's grounds include an extensive cliff and seashore park of
            54 acres designed by the archduke. The grounds were
            completely re-landscaped to feature numerous tropical species of
            trees and plants.

          <h2>Piazza dell'Unità d'Italia</h2>
          <p>
            Piazza dell'Unità d'Italia is the main square in Trieste, a seaport
            city in northeast Italy. Located at the foot of the hill with the
            castle of San Giusto, the square faces the Adriatic Sea. It is often
            said to be Europe's largest square located next to the sea. The
            square was built during the period when Trieste was the most
            important seaport of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire and includes the
            city's municipal buildings and other important palaces.
