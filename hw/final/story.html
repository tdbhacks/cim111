              Our love story began in Miami, back in 2009. Dominic was a
              frequent customer at Greenstreet Cafe, where Alexandra served up
              his morning cappuccino.
              <br><br>
              Some flirtatious banter was exchanged back and forth over the
              coffee machine for weeks, even after Dominic was transferred to an
              office across the city – taking an extra two train stops each day
              for his morning brew. He finally slipped his business card over
              the counter, and after discovering a mutual love of travel, design
              and late-night karaoke bars, the rest is history!
              <br><br>
              6 years worth of memories later and we’ve backpacked through
              India, renovated our dream home and introduced 2 furry pups to
              our family. A few months ago Dominic finally popped the question
              over coffee and croissants, back at our favourite cafe where it
              all began, and Alexandra said yes. We can’t wait for this exciting
              new chapter to begin!
